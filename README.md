* **Easily access and interact with your Gemini AI.** Just type in your query and GeminiShell will do the rest.
* **Get help with coding, debugging, and other tasks.** Gemini AI can answer your questions and provide helpful suggestions.
* **Automate repetitive tasks.** Gemini AI can generate automation scripts which you will be able to run right away with the press of a button.

## Getting Started

To get started with GeminiShell, you will need to:

1. **Install GeminiShell.** Check out the Installation Instructions below.
3. **Configure GeminiShell.** The installtion process creates a configuration file in `$XDG_DESKTOP_HOME/.config/geminishell/config.toml`. Check out the things you can configure [here](https://example.com) (not yet implemented)

## Using GeminiShell

Once you have configured GeminiShell, you can start using it to interact with the Gemini AI. To do this, type this:

geminishell -p "Hey Gemini !"
```

Geminishell can read from stdin. This is possible by just piping the information into geminishell as follows:
```bash
ls | geminishell -p "Give me instructions on how to clean my home folder"
tree . | geminishell -p "Give me the best folder structure for a python project based on my existing one."
```

You can also use geminishell interactively! This allows geminishell to remember information while you are in the chat.
```bash
geminishell -i
>>> Provide a definition for moulting.
Moulting is the process of shedding the outer layer of the skin or covering
, along with any associated structures, such as hair, feathers, or antlers. It is a natural process that occurs in many animals, including reptiles, birds,
 mammals, and arthropods. Moulting allows animals to replace old or damaged coverings with new ones, as well as to get rid of parasites and other debris that may have accumulated on the surface of the body.
>>> Which animals undergo this process?
Many animals undergo the process of moulting, including:
* **Arthropods:
    * Insects (e.g., butterflies, beetles, cockroaches)
    * Arachnids (e.g., spiders, scorpions,
 ticks)
    * Crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters, shrimp)
# And so on..
```
